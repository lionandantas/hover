# Hello World

It doesn't take much to get started with your own Hover menu.  At a minimum, you need to handle the
following responsibilities:

1. Get permission to show an overlay (Android M and above).
1. Extend HoverMenuService to show your own Hover menu.
1. Implement a HoverMenu that provides the tabs and content you want in your menu.
1. Send an Intent to your HoverMenuService to start it.
